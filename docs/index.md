## {{ page.title }}

**Typetron** is a **modern Node.js framework**, written in [**Typescript**](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), that allows you to build 
fully-featured applications. Typetron is best suited for small sized to enterprise level apps.
Most of the core packages it uses were built from scratch, in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/),
in order to preserve the performance of the framework. 
 

### Features
Typetron aims to have all the features necessary for building any web app possible without the need for you
to search for a package to use. Almost all the packages it has were built from scratch and are available
in the framework out of the box. 
This was done to ensure that all the features you are using benefit from the latest language features. 
Also, every package can be tuned for performance or updated in no time if needed.

Some of the big features **Typetron** offers are:

### Performance
Being built with packages created from scratch using the latest features from Typescript, Typetron 
comes with really good performance out of the box, compared to other available frameworks.

### Developer experience
Typetron's source code is built around developer's expectations: it is modern, clean and beautiful.
Also, the tools Typetron is providing are everything a developer needs to build his next awesome project.

### Code sharing
A few years ago we wrote websites. Nowadays we write web applications. The web evolved along with the tools
we are using. A typical web application is composed from at least two parts: a backend app and a frontend app.
This separation led to two different camps that have a very distinct line between them. Typetron aims to 
bring tools that lets the developer bring these two camps together.    

### Typescript
Javascript is the language of the web, but Javascript alone is not very powerful. When working on enterprise
level apps, it will slow down the development making the project feel tedious to work with. Typescript
provides static typing, classes and interfaces giving you and IDEs to richer environment
for spotting common errors as you type the code. 

Typetron was build in Typescript's **strict mode** which enforces you to write a more robust
code base making your app free of bugs.
