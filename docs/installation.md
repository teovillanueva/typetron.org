### Requirements

Before you start using Typetron, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

### Installation

To start using Typetron, clone the blank project from Github:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/typetron/typetron my-awesome-project
```

And go into your project's directory and install the required dependencies:
```sh
$ cd my-awesome-project
$ npm install
```

In order to serve your project you can run the `start` script inside:
```sh
$ npm start
```
 
This will create a development server on you machine that automatically reloads the app when you make code changes.
You can open you app at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Next steps
We recommend you go to the [**Tutorials**](/tutorials) section if you are just getting started with Typetron since they are 
constructed so the newcomer will understand every feature better.
